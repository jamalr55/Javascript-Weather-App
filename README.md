## Jamal's Porfolio App 3

5 Day Weather Forecast web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

Live Demo: https://5-day-weather-app.netlify.app/

Let's talk about the application; my weather app will show the weather information for the today an the next 4 days that it will get from the OpenWeatherMap.org API, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description, and then the user's city and country.

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
